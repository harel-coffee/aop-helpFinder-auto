# AOP-HelpFinder : A tool to help users to establish adverse outcomes pathways.

---
## DESCRIPTION
This software linked adverse outcomes, diseases and key-events with reviews.
This is based on a text mining and parsing process on abstract.
Software implemented for Human Biomonintoring in Europe (HBM4EU) Work Package
13.1.

## Python Compatibility 
This program is compatible with python 3.x.


## Installation

### Installation & usage from sources

1. Clone this repo `git clone https://github.com/jcarvaill/aop-helpFinder`
2. Install dependancies:
   2.1. Using pip (and use python environment system)
    
        `sudo pip install -r requirements.txt`
       or
        `sudo pip3 install -r requirements.txt`
 
   2.2. Using virtualenv, suggested (use a virtual environment, leaving your python installation untouched)
    
      - To install virtualenv via pip:
        `sudo pip install virtualenv`
       or
        `sudo pip3 install virtualenv`

      - To create a virtual environment for aop-helpFinder:
        `virtualenv aop-helpFinder_venv

      - Don't forget to activate environment with:
        `source {PATH}/aop-helpfinder_venv/bin/activate`

     (- To deactivate environment: `deactivate`)

      - Same as 2.1.

   2.3. (Easy) Using directly aop-helpFinder scripts

        `python {PATH}/aop-helpfinder/aop-helpFinder.py`
        or
        `python3 {PATH}/aop-helpfinder/aop-helpFinder.py`

        To proceed, bin directory should be conserved

3. Use aop-helpFinder scripts with `python {PATH}/aop-helpFinder/aop-helpFinder.py` or `python3 {PATH}/aop-helpFinder/aop-helpFinder.py`

## USAGE: 
cd src/aop_finder/

aop-helpFinder/data/raw-data directory contains abstracts of reviews in multiple files.
You can use these files to test the software.
aop-helpFinder/output directory contains results of the software in function of input file.

Command to launch an analyze on BPS reviews not including Comparative
Toxicogenomics Database diseases vocabulary file:

 ```text
 python3 aop_finder.py -d database/bisphenolS_AO.db -i data/raw-data/BPS/
-cdt output/cytoscape_nodes_bisphenolS_AO.tsv
-cne output/cytoscape_network_bisphenolS_AO.tsv
-a data/AOPwiki/61-current-AO-25Aout2017.txt -cpu 8
```

Command to launch an analyze on BPS reviews including Comparative
Toxicogenomics Database diseases vocabulary file:

 ```text
 python3 aop_finder.py -d database/bisphenolS_AO.db -i data/raw-data/BPS/
-cdt output/cytoscape_nodes_bisphenolS_AO.tsv
